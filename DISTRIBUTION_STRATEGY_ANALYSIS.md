# Distribution Strategy Analysis: AVA CRM Workflow Integration

## Current State
We have a powerful workflow integration system, but it requires:
- Manual webhook URL copying
- Custom JavaScript integration
- Technical knowledge to implement

## Distribution Options

### 1. **NPM Package** 📦
**Target:** Developers, React/Vue/Angular apps

**Pros:**

- Version control
- Developer-friendly API

**Cons:**

**Implementation:**
```javascript
import { AVAForm } from 'ava-crm-integration';

const form = new AVAForm({
  workflowId: 'workflow_123',
  fields: {
    name: 'fullName',
    email: 'email',
    message: 'inquiryMessage'
  }
});

form.mount('#contact-form');
```
