## 🎯 Zapier Strategy Recommendations

### **Option 1: Zapier-First (Like iclosed.io)**
- Build Zapier app as primary integration method
- Focus on app-to-app connections
- Use Zapier's form builders (like their form steps)
- Position as "Connect your forms to AVA CRM"

### **Option 2: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep our webhook system for direct integrations
- Add Zapier app for app-to-app connections
- Best of both worlds

### **Option 3: Zapier-Only**
- Abandon custom webhook, go all-in on Zapier
- Simpler maintenance, but less control

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Do BOTH approaches** - they're complementary:

2. **Add Zapier integration** for app-to-app connections (business users)

**Why both?**

- **Zapier**: Easy, reliable, connects to business stack
- **Market coverage**: Technical + non-technical users
- **Revenue streams**: Freemium webhook + Zapier partnerships
